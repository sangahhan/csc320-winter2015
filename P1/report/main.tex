\begin{homeworkProblem}

\noindent \textit{Dataset description}

The dataset consists of images that contain 3 vertically stacked photos that have been taken in greyscale, but through blue, green, and red filters respectively. Four examples of these images are shown in  Figure~\ref{fig:sampleinput}.

\begin{figure*}[h!]

    \caption{Low-resolution sample input photos.}
    \label{fig:sampleinput}
\end{figure*}

To align the photos properly, the black borders around each photo must be taken into account when applying a patch matching method. Some of the input photos are lower-resolution \emph{.jpg} files, while others are higher-resolution \emph{.png} files.

%	PROBLEM 2
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{homeworkProblem}
\noindent \textit{Applying an algorithm: initial exploration.}

%Obtain the colour image for several examples by matching the inverted negatives using both NCC and SSD.ï¿¼In your report, indicate which seems to work better. Are there any artefacts in the output? What may explain the artefacts For Part 1, you may assume that the input image will be of size similar to that of 00757v.jpg

Using the low-resolution \emph{.jpg}'s from the given dataset of images, colour images were obtained using both \emph{Normalized Cross-Correlation} (NCC) and \emph{Sum of Square Differenced} (SSD) template matching methods.  

For the most part, the two methods, SSD and NCC, produced very similar results, as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:part1outputa}, and in Figure~\ref{fig:part1outputd}

\begin{figure*}[h!]
    \begin{center}
        \displayImage{00757v_part1out.png}{0.5}
        \caption{Left: coloured version of Figure ~\ref{fig:sampleinput}(a), aligned with SSD. Right: coloured version of ~\ref{fig:sampleinput}(a), aligned with NCC.}
        \label{fig:part1outputa}
    \end{center}
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure*}[h!]
    \begin{center}
        \displayImage{00106v_part1out.png}{0.5}
        \caption{Left: coloured version of Figure ~\ref{fig:sampleinput}(d), aligned with SSD. Right: coloured version of ~\ref{fig:sampleinput}(d), aligned with NCC.}
        \label{fig:part1outputd}
    \end{center}
\end{figure*}

However, not all of the inputs produced perfect outputs, for various reason. One being the range of displacement used to test alignment of the photos-- this task specified to test alignment by displacing the photos 10 pixels each way (left, right, up and down) and obtaining the displacement with the best score. For some images, this score was best achieved with a displacement of more than 10 pixels, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:part1outputc}.

\begin{figure*}

    \begin{subfigure}[b]{1\textwidth}
        \begin{center}
        \displayImage{00911v_part1out.png}{0.5}
        \caption{Left: coloured version of Figure~\ref{fig:sampleinput}(c), aligned with SSD. Right: coloured version of Figure~\ref{fig:sampleinput}(c), aligned with NCC. Both images checked for alignment for displacements up to 10 pixels.}
        \end{center}
    \end{subfigure}
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{1\textwidth}
        \begin{center}
        \displayImage{00911v_part1out2.png}{0.5}
        \caption{Left: coloured version of Figure~\ref{fig:sampleinput}(c), aligned with SSD. Right: coloured version of Figure~\ref{fig:sampleinput}(c), aligned with NCC. Both images checked for alignment for displacements up to 15 pixels.}
         \end{center}
    \end{subfigure}
\caption{}
\label{fig:part1outputc}
\end{figure*}

\clearpage

The resulting photos from applying both SSD and NCC in Figure~\ref{fig:part1outputc}(a) were not enough to align the images perfectly. It was only until the range of displacements to test alignments was increased (shown in Figure~\ref{fig:part1outputc}(b)) that it was possible to align them perfectly. 

Finally, there were some images for which the two methods did not yield similar results. Figure~\ref{fig:part1outputb} shows an example of this occurrence. Though SSD is more computationally efficient compared to NCC, SSD is also more sensitive to the intensity of the images being compared. NCC avoids this by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for every point. 
\begin{figure*}[h!]
    \begin{center}
        \displayImage{00907v_part1out.png}{0.5}
        \caption{Left: coloured version of Figure ~\ref{fig:sampleinput}(b), aligned with SSD. Right: coloured version of ~\ref{fig:sampleinput}(b), aligned with NCC.}
        \label{fig:part1outputb}
    \end{center}
\end{figure*}

Another possible method for is the zero-mean variation of NCC, which involves the same steps, except we take the mean to be zero. Though it may yield more accurate results in relation to SSD, there were still some cases where it was not up to par with its non-zero-mean variation. E.g. in Figure~\ref{fig:part1outputb_zeroncc}, the red and blue channels are well-aligned, but the green channel is somewhat misplaced, resulting in a yellow "shadow" effect visible to the left of the building.
\begin{figure*}[h!]
    \begin{center}
        \displayImage{00907v_part1out2.png}{0.4}
        \caption{Coloured version of ~\ref{fig:sampleinput}(b), aligned with zero-mean NCC.}
        \label{fig:part1outputb_zeroncc}
    \end{center}
\end{figure*}

From the output of these sample inputs, as well as other input images from the dataset, it seems that using NCC to align the photos would result in more well-aligned output photos. Though SSD requires a lot less computation, SSD is more likely to produce skewed results, making NCC the more reliable choice.

%	PROBLEM 3
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{homeworkProblem}
\noindent \textit{Applying the problem to larger inputs from the dataset.}

%The technique from Part 1 will only work for small images, and will take too long for larger images. This problem can be solved by rescaling the images with scipy.misc.imresize(), matching the small versions of the images to obtain a rough estimate of the match, and only then matching the large versions of the images. This procedure could be repeated several times. Implement matching so that it works for larger images as well. In the report, describe your results and the runtimes that you obtain.

Earlier, in the description of the dataset, higher-resolution \emph{.png} files were mentioned, but were not dealt with in Part 1 of this assignment. To efficiently handle these higher-resolution images, a different approach is needed, as the technique from Part 1 requires a large deal of computation that deals with the entire image, which in this case, tends to go up to 10 times the size of what we were dealing with in Part 1. Additionally, the approach from Part 1 would not produce accurate results for this part of the dataset, due to the discrepancy in size: we would need to test alignments for displacements that are more proportional to the images (10 pixels is not enough). For these reasons, the higher-resolution images will be aligned using an image pyramid, a series that consists of the imae
